# Machine Learning Classification with KNN and SVM

## Project Overview
This project involves implementing machine learning models to solve a supervised classification problem using the Scikit-Learn library and a custom KNN classifier. The task is to predict categories based on a given dataset, evaluating models based on their prediction accuracy.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9
- Scikit-Learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)
- Ensure you have the necessary Python environment to run Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts.
